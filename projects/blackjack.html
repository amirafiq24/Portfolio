            I built a Blackjack-playing AI that learns entirely through experience, 
            training itself by playing thousands of simulated games. Instead of being 
            programmed with fixed rules, the agent gradually discovers when to hit or 
            stick by observing which choices lead to better outcomes over time. After 
            enough practice, it develops strategy patterns that closely match optimal 
            Blackjack play, even in tricky situations like dealing with strong dealer 
            cards or managing soft hands. In the end, the agent reaches a stable win 
            rate near the theoretical best, making the project a fun and rewarding 
            demonstration of how reinforcement learning can teach an AI to make smart 
            decisions.
