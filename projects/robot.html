            Our team designed and built a line-following robot powered by Arduino 
            that competed in the Pathfinder Competition. I was responsible for 
            programming the robot's core behavior, enabling it to follow a black line 
            using a color sensor while detecting obstacles via ultrasonic sensing. We 
            implemented logic for path correction, dynamic turning, and real-time 
            decision-making to ensure smooth autonomous navigation. The robot executed 
            multi-angle scanning routines to recover from off-track situations and 
            intelligently handled blocked paths. Our well-coordinated teamwork and 
            innovative approach led us to win first place in the competition, along 
            with a $300 prize for our performance.
